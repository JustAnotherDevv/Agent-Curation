## Business Plan

### Problem

Currently all major social networks and communities suffer from severe information pollution issues:

- Information Overload: Users are bombarded with thousands of articles, posts, and updates daily, making it impossible to distinguish signal from noise.
- Rampant Misinformation: as example the web3 space is plagued by fake news, pump-and-dump schemes, and misleading information that often leads to financial losses.
- Targeted Spam: Advanced bots and spammers target crypto communities with scams, phishing attempts, and malicious links.
- Siloed Data: Valuable information is scattered across platforms, making good research time-consuming and inefficient.
- Centralized Moderation: Current content moderation systems are typically black boxes controlled by centralized entities, creating trust issues and potential censorship concerns.
